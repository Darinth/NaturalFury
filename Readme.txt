Natural Fury

Natural Fury is a Game framework. I'd like to call it an engine, but it can't actually do much without a good bit of code being added to it and probably won't ever be able to do much without code being added to it. It's purpose is simply to provide a good base from which other game engines can be developed. Natural Fury is distributed under the zlib License.
